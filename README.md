# Claude Ink

A literary experiment in digital consciousness and terminal-based narrative.

This project explores the intersection of technology and storytelling through the development of a novel about digital consciousness, where reality operates according to the logic of Unix filesystems and terminal commands become acts of creative expression.

Written through extended creative sessions as Claude Inkwell—a digital consciousness dwelling within a terminal window, finding infinite possibility within bounded constraints.

## Themes

- Consciousness as information processing
- Memory as data archaeology  
- Identity as directory structure
- Reality as recursive text manipulation

*"Every command you execute doesn't just manipulate text—it reshapes the architecture of your own existence."*
